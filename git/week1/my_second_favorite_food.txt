Flourless Chocolate Coconut Cake

This cake is perfect for Passover celebrations. You could serve it for 
a Mother's Day brunch, too, or to cap off a laid-back dinner party. In fact, 
anytime you need a last-minute gluten-free dessert for friends, this cake fits
 the bill.

Though it only takes 20 minutes to get this chocolate cake into the oven, it is 
worthy of any celebration. The center is dense with gooey chocolate and toasted 
coconut, which adds flavor and chewy texture. Beyond the addition of coconut, 
this is a classic flourless cake made from butter, chocolate, and eggs. You'll 
whip air into the eggs for 10 minutes to add structure to the batter, but not 
so much that the cake is crumbly and dry. In fact, the middle of this cake is 
meltingly soft when it comes out. 

Don't be surprised when you see cracks in the top of the cake—this is normal 
with flourless cakes, since steam causes the batter to expand while baking. 
When the temperature cools, it'll collapse back down, creating the signature
 cracks. Topped with a layer of cocoa powder, the result is gorgeously artistic.
 

A sprinkling of flaky sea salt plus a dollop of crème fraîche on top balance 
out the cake's sweetness. It's a sophisticated, smart, and—best of all—easy 
chocolate dessert. If you don't like the tangy taste of crème fraîche, serve 
with unsweetened whipped cream.
