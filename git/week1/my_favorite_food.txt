CHICKEN BIRIYANI

Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's 
typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan.
 It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. 
For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
Directions
1.Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until 
lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to 
drain; set aside.
2.Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, 
and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, 
salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 
5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and 
cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. 
It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes
too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
3.Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. 
Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. 
Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 
20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm 
serving dish.
